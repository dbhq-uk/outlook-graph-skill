---

Read your inbox, draft and send properly formatted replies and forwards, triage with flags and
categories, manage attachments up to 150 MB, and run your calendar - including responding to
invites and inviting attendees - all from Claude Code or Codex, in plain language.
Multi-account, OAuth-based, and built with the safety rails that matter for real
correspondence.

Two skills ship in this pack:

| Skill | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **`outlook-graph`** | Live Microsoft 365 mail and calendar via the Graph API | OAuth, network |
| **`outlook-to-md`** | Turns PST exports and live mail into integrity-verified markdown, offline | Nothing but a file |

They cover the two halves of the same problem: the mail you are handling now, and the mail you
were handed in a box - and they join up, so one archive spans both. `outlook-to-md` itself
needs no credentials and makes no network calls; it reads files on disk, whether they came out
of a PST or out of `outlook-graph`.

## Why it is different

**Reply-all by default.** Replies preserve every original `To:` and `Cc:` recipient, so you
never silently drop someone from a thread. Trim to sender-only when you actually mean to.
Losing a recipient by accident is invisible from your side; sending to one person too many is
not.

**Reads the whole message, never the preview.** The skill is instructed to open the full body
end-to-end before summarising or replying, so deadlines, attachments and requests buried below
the fold are not missed.

**Nothing leaves without a second command.** Drafting and sending are different verbs, and so
are creating an event and inviting anyone to it. An agent driving a mailbox is one confident
inference away from mailing a client; the gap is where a person gets to look.

**Time-aware.** It anchors "today", "tomorrow" and "by EOD" against the real clock and tracks
BST against UTC, so scheduled sends and deadline arithmetic are correct. Calendar times are
wall-clock in a timezone it tells you about rather than assumes.

**Professional formatting.** Markdown drafts convert to clean HTML with the Microsoft 365
Aptos font stack and inline styles - including per-paragraph margins - that survive Outlook's
rendering.

**It asks for five permissions and no more.** `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`,
`Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read`, `offline_access`, all delegated. Nothing tenant-wide,
nothing that can reach another mailbox, and no admin consent to obtain.

## What it covers

```bash
outlook-graph-mail.sh      inbox · unread · focused · sent · drafts · flagged · folder · from
                           search · thread · read · preview · export
                           draft · mddraft · reply · mdreply · forward · followup
                           update · send · aliases
                           attachments · download · attach
                           markread · flag · categorize · categories · junk · archive · delete
                           move · batch-move · mkdir · rename · rmdir · folders · stats

outlook-graph-calendar.sh  events · today · week · day · search · read · calendars
                           create · invite · quick · update · respond · cancel · delete · free

outlook-graph-token.sh     refresh · get · test · status · list

outlook_to_md.py           <pst-or-eml-dir> <output-dir> [--append --timezone --owner-email …]
```

You normally type none of this - you ask, and the skill picks the command. Every argument,
flag and default is in [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md).

## Install

### As a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add dbhq-uk/marketplace
/plugin install outlook-graph@dbhq
```

Then run the one-time setup the skill points you to, and talk to it in plain language: *"check
my email"*, *"draft a reply to the last message from Sam"*, *"am I free Thursday afternoon"*.

### Any agent (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Cline and more)

```bash
npx skills add dbhq-uk/outlook-graph-skill
```

The [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI installs into whichever agent directories it finds, so
this works outside Claude Code and Codex too. Both skills come in one command.

### Local install (Claude Code or Codex)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbhq-uk/outlook-graph-skill.git
cd outlook-graph-skill
./install.sh          # Claude Code: symlinks into ~/.claude/skills (edits are live)
./install-codex.sh    # Codex: installs into ~/.codex/skills
```

First run launches `outlook-graph-setup.sh`, which registers an Azure app and signs you in.
Credentials are stored per account under `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/`, never leave your
machine, and refresh themselves. The whole install-to-first-email path is
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Requirements

Checked per skill - a missing dependency skips that skill rather than failing the install, so
you can take either half on its own.

| Skill | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `outlook-graph` | `azure-cli` · `jq` · `curl` | `pandoc` (markdown-formatted emails) |
| `outlook-to-md` | `python3` (3.9+) | `readpst` (`pst-utils`; fallback PST backend) |

`outlook-to-md` provisions its own virtualenv on install. Its preferred PST backend pins an
old numpy and cannot install on Python 3.12 or later, so `setup.sh` picks a 3.9-3.11
interpreter when one exists and otherwise builds without it and says so - see [the Python
version problem](docs/architecture.md#the-python-version-problem).

## Documentation

**[The documentation index](docs/README.md)** reaches everything. Start with [getting
started](docs/getting-started.md) to set it up, [handling a thread](docs/guides/email.md) and
[running the calendar](docs/guides/calendar.md) to use it, [the
reference](docs/reference.md) to look a command up, and [how the pack is
built](docs/architecture.md) to understand why it behaves the way it does. There are also
guides for [markdown archives](docs/guides/archiving.md) and [accounts and
tokens](docs/guides/accounts.md).

Hacking on it, or running from source with live edits: [docs/dev-setup.md](docs/dev-setup.md),
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) if you are an AI agent doing so.

## Credentials and privacy

No secrets live in this repository. Your tokens are stored locally under `~/.outlook-graph/`
and used only to talk to Microsoft Graph directly from your machine.
