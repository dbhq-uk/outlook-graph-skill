# Outlook Email to Markdown

Turn Outlook mail into an organised, integrity-verified archive of markdown files, raw email backups, and attachments. Reads a PST export, or a directory of `.eml` files - which is how live mail arrives, via the `outlook` skill's `export` verb. Supports full extraction and incremental append mode, so one archive can span both.

## Prerequisites

- Python virtual environment set up (run setup.sh if not done)
- `readpst` (system tool from pst-utils), to read a `.pst`. A directory of `.eml` files does not need it

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Set up Python environment (one-time)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/setup.sh
```

### System Dependency for PST Files

`readpst` is the only PST reader. If `setup.sh` reports it missing, ask the user to install it:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install pst-utils

# macOS
brew install libpst
```

## Extraction Operations

### Full Extraction

Extract all emails from a PST file into markdown:

```bash
# Basic extraction
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/

# Verbose output with progress
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --verbose

# Include deleted items
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --include-deleted --verbose

# Render every date in one zone (default: the offset each message was sent with)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --timezone "Europe/London"

# Fix MAILER-DAEMON sent items (provide the PST owner's email)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --owner-email "user@example.com"
```

### Incremental Extraction (Append Mode)

Add only new emails (skips already-extracted messages by Message-ID):

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --append --verbose
```

### Keeping an Archive Current from Live Mail

A PST is a snapshot. To carry an archive forward, export new mail with the
`outlook` skill and append it: the two produce the same shape.

1. Export the folder as `.eml` with the outlook skill's `export` verb, for
   example `export "Inbox/Clients" ./staging/ --since 2026-07-01`. Its own
   instructions give the command. `--count N` caps how many messages it
   writes, newest first (default 1000). If the outlook skill is not installed
   or not configured, say so and stop: this skill cannot read live mail.
2. Append the staging directory to the existing archive:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py \
  ./staging/ ./archive/ --append
```

Deduplication is by `Message-ID`, so a `--since` window that overlaps what is
already archived costs bandwidth and nothing else. Graph-sourced mail is
recorded under the `pst_folder` index column like any other; the column means
"the folder this message came from".

This guarantee depends on the message actually carrying a `Message-ID`
header. Received mail always has one, but a message with none (some drafts,
some malformed mail) has no key to dedupe on and is re-archived as a fresh
entry on every overlapping run. Narrow in practice, but real: there is no
content-hash fallback.

### Extract from Pre-Extracted .eml Directory

If emails were already extracted with readpst elsewhere, point at the directory:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py /path/to/eml-directory/ /path/to/output/
```

### Email Markdown Format

Each `email.md` contains:
- **YAML frontmatter**: message_id, date, from, to, cc, subject, attachments with SHA256 hashes
- **Formatted body**: HTML converted to markdown, or plain text preserved
- **Attachment links**: Relative links to extracted files with sizes
- **Original headers**: Full RFC 822 headers in code block

### Index Files

- **index.csv**: All emails with date, sender, recipient, subject, folder, attachment count
- **index.md**: Timeline view grouped by year/month with links to each email

## CLI Reference

```
outlook_to_md.py [-h] [--include-deleted] [--timezone TZ] [--verbose] [--append | --overwrite] [--owner-email EMAIL] pst_file output_dir
```

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `pst_file` | Path to PST file, or directory of pre-extracted .eml files |
| `output_dir` | Output directory (created if needed) |
| `--include-deleted` | Include deleted items from PST (passes `-D` to readpst) |
| `--timezone TZ` | Render every date in this IANA zone, e.g. `Europe/London`. An unknown name is refused. Default: the offset each message was sent with |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Verbose output with per-email logging |
| `--append` | Skip emails already in archive (by Message-ID) |
| `--overwrite` | Replace an existing archive: deletes its `emails/` folder and index files first |
| `--owner-email EMAIL` | PST owner's email (fixes MAILER-DAEMON in sent items) |

With neither flag, an output directory that already holds an archive is refused. Use
`--append` to add to it. Use `--overwrite` only when the user has asked to rebuild it.

## Extraction Backends

A directory input (pre-extracted `.eml` files) is handled directly and needs
nothing else. A PST file is read with **readpst** (from pst-utils), run as
`readpst -j 0 -e -8 -o <tmp> <pst>` with `-D` added by `--include-deleted`. Its
`.eml` output then goes through the same path as a directory input. `-j 0`
turns off readpst's parallel jobs, which can drop messages without an error.
If you run readpst yourself and point this tool at the output, pass `-j 0` too.

## Integrity Verification

Every extraction produces a verifiable chain of custody:

1. Each email folder has `checksums.sha256` (SHA256 of all its files)
2. `manifest.sha256` hashes all checksum files plus the index
3. Source PST SHA256 is recorded in the manifest

To verify: `sha256sum -c manifest.sha256`

## Workflow: Extract and Search

Extract, then search the markdown with ripgrep. There is no semantic index - the output is plain files on disk, so use whatever search you already trust.

```bash
# Step 1: Extract
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook_to_md.py archive.pst ./email-output/ --verbose

# Step 2: Search the output
rg -i "settlement agreement" ./email-output/ -l
```

Grep is exact, so search on names, addresses and distinctive phrases rather than concepts.

## Error Handling

- **"readpst is not installed"**: Install pst-utils (`sudo apt install pst-utils`, or `brew install libpst` on macOS)
- **Corrupt emails**: Logged to extraction_log.txt, processing continues
- **Encoding issues**: Falls back through UTF-8 → latin-1 → raw bytes
- **Duplicate timestamps**: Appended with -001, -002 suffixes
- **Path too long**: Subject truncated, uniqueness preserved

## Performance

| Scenario | Approximate Speed |
|----------|-------------------|
| Emails without attachments | ~5,000/hour |
| Emails with attachments | ~2,000/hour |

A typical 300MB PST (~1,000-3,000 emails) processes in 5-15 minutes.
