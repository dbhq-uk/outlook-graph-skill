# Outlook Email & Calendar

Access Microsoft 365 Outlook email and calendar via Microsoft Graph API.

## CRITICAL: Replies preserve ALL original recipients (reply-all by default)

**`reply`, `mdreply`, and `followup` use Microsoft Graph's `createReplyAll` endpoint. The new draft includes every `To:` and `Cc:` recipient from the original message — not just the sender.**

Mandatory rules:

1. **Always read the original message's full `To:` and `Cc:` lists BEFORE creating a reply.** Use a direct API call if `read` truncates: `curl … "/me/messages/<id>?$select=toRecipients,ccRecipients"`. Knowing who's on the thread is part of "reading the full body end-to-end" — do not skip it.
2. **After creating any reply draft, confirm the displayed `To:`, `Cc:`, and `Bcc:` lines match what you intended.** All three reply commands now print every recipient (not just `To[0]`). If the list looks short, the original might have had CCs you missed — re-check before sending.
3. **If you genuinely want sender-only**, create the reply, then run `update to <sender-email>` and `update cc ""` (or manually edit) to trim recipients. Default is "everyone stays in the loop".
4. **Never assume a single-recipient `To:` means a single-recipient thread.** Estate agents, solicitors, accountants, and courts routinely Cc colleagues, assistants, and audit addresses. Dropping those CCs on reply is a real harm — they stop seeing the conversation.

This rule exists because a previous reply silently dropped two CCs (assistant addresses on an estate-agent thread); the recipients had to be looped back in via a follow-up email. Reply-all is now the default to make recipient loss impossible by accident.

## CRITICAL: Reading email content

**`preview` is a snippet (first ~200 chars of body), not the full message. NEVER use `preview` to analyse, summarise, respond to, or report on email content. A short preview does NOT mean a short message — the message can continue for many paragraphs and contain attachments, requests, deadlines, or substantive content not visible in the preview.**

Mandatory rules:

1. **Use `read <message-id>` for any substantive engagement** with an email — analysis, summary, reply, decision-making, documentation. Always.
2. **Use `preview` only for navigation** — finding the right message ID from a list, confirming a subject line, checking date/sender. Never for content.
3. **If the `read` output gets truncated** by terminal/tool limits, extract the body via grep or jq with a wide enough regex to capture the whole message. Do not stop at the first match.
4. **Before replying to or reporting on a message, confirm internally**: "Have I read the full body end-to-end, including any attachment list and request lines?"
5. **For long reply chains**: the `read` output includes the quoted prior chain. Identify the body of the *current* message (between the headers `---` separator and the start of the quoted chain) and ensure that body is fully captured before doing anything else.

This rule exists because trusting previews has led to missing critical content (attachments, action requests, deadlines, off-chain coordination signals). It is non-negotiable.

## Time and date awareness

Email correspondence routinely uses relative times — "today", "yesterday", "by tomorrow", "this morning", "by EOD Tuesday". Each of those is ambiguous without an anchor.

Mandatory rules:

1. **At the start of any email work, run `date` via Bash** to confirm the current date/time. Never assume the date from earlier in the conversation — the conversation may span days, and the system date can roll over.
2. **When computing deadlines or "ago" references**, anchor against actual `date` output, not memory. Example: an email timestamped `2026-05-06T16:10:58Z` is Wednesday 6 May at 17:10 BST (UTC+1 in summer), not yesterday.
3. **When an email is about to be sent**, confirm the date in the planned send is correct (the date you're embedding in the body must match the date the email will actually arrive).
4. **Track timezone explicitly** (BST vs UTC). UK summer time = UTC+1. Microsoft Graph timestamps are UTC.
5. **Check `OUTLOOK_TZ` before quoting any calendar time.** All calendar commands report and accept wall-clock time in the configured timezone, which defaults to the *system* timezone. Servers, containers and CI boxes are almost always UTC while the mailbox owner is not — and then a 14:00 London meeting is reported as "13:00". Same instant, wrong wall-clock, missed meeting. The calendar script prints its active timezone and warns when it is UTC-by-default; if that zone is not the user's, export `OUTLOOK_TZ` (e.g. `OUTLOOK_TZ=Europe/London`) before trusting any time.

If unsure of the date or time, run `date` and `date -u` (UTC) before responding.

## Email font and formatting preferences

The skill applies these inline styles to every markdown-converted email body, on every command (`mddraft`, `mdreply`, `forward`, `followup`, `update mdbody`):

| Property | Value | Why inline |
|---|---|---|
| **Font family** | `'Aptos', 'Aptos Display', 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif` | Aptos is the Microsoft 365 default since 2024. Falls back to Segoe UI on older Outlook, Roboto / system sans on non-Microsoft clients. Inline `style=""` survives Outlook's `<style>`-block stripping. |
| **Font size** | `14px` | Readable, professional |
| **Line height** | `1.5` (mddraft / update mdbody) or `1.6` (mdreply / forward / followup) | Comfortable spacing |
| **Colour** | `#333` | Soft black; avoids harsh `#000` |
| **Paragraph margin** | `0 0 14px 0` (inline on every `<p>` tag) | Outlook ignores `<p>` margins from `<style>` blocks but respects inline. Without this, paragraphs collapse together until Outlook re-renders the draft after an edit. |

All of this is implemented in ONE place: the `md_to_html` helper (and its `FONT_STACK` variable) in `scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh`. To change font preferences globally, edit that helper.

## Multiple accounts

Each account stores credentials under `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/`. The active account is selected by (in order of precedence): `--account <name>` / `-a <name>` flag, the `OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT` env var, then `default`.

```bash
# Default account
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh inbox

# Named account (flag)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh -a work inbox

# Named account (env var)
OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT=work ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh inbox

# List configured accounts
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-token.sh list

# Add a new account (reuses existing Azure app registration if one exists)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-setup.sh --account work
```

An existing single-account install at `~/.outlook-graph/{config,credentials,id_cache}.json` is auto-migrated to `~/.outlook-graph/default/` on the first run of any script.

Calendar timezone is auto-detected from the system. Override with `OUTLOOK_TZ`, e.g. `OUTLOOK_TZ=America/New_York ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh today`.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials configured in `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/` (run setup if not done)
- Azure CLI, jq, curl installed

**Note:** Tokens are automatically refreshed when needed. No manual intervention required.

${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh inbox

# List more messages
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh inbox 25

# Unread only
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh unread

# 1000, or "all"). Results come back ranked by Graph, then sorted newest-first.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh search "project update"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh search "invoice" 50

# Search with KQL for precision: field operators (subject:, from:, to:, body:)
# and booleans (AND/OR/NOT). The query is passed through to Graph's $search.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh search 'subject:invoice AND from:jane@example.com'
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh search 'from:acme.com AND body:renewal' all

# Messages flagged for follow-up (newest first)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh flagged

# The whole conversation a message belongs to (oldest first) - use this to see
# a full back-and-forth thread across inbox and sent items
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh thread <message-id>

# Read full message (use ID from list)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh read <message-id>

# Quick preview (subject, from, date, body preview)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh preview <message-id>
```

### Sending Email

```bash
# Create plain text draft
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh draft "recipient@example.com" "Subject" "Body text"

# Create markdown-formatted draft (converts to HTML)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mddraft "recipient@example.com" "Subject" "**Bold** and _italic_ text"

# Send a draft (use draft ID)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh send <draft-id>

# Reply to a message (plain text - creates draft, REPLY-ALL: includes original To: + Cc:)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh reply <message-id> "Reply body"

# Reply with markdown formatting (converts to HTML - creates draft, REPLY-ALL: includes original To: + Cc:)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mdreply <message-id> "**Bold** reply with _formatting_"

# (For sender-only reply, create the draft then trim recipients via `update to`/`update cc`.)

# Send reply draft
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh send <reply-draft-id>

# Forward a message (creates a DRAFT with the quoted message + its attachments).
# Recipients are comma/semicolon-separated; the optional comment is markdown.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh forward <message-id> "to@example.com"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh forward <message-id> "a@x.com, b@y.com" "FYI - see the thread below, **deadline is Friday**."

# Follow up on your own sent email (chaser)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh followup <sent-message-id>
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh followup <sent-message-id> "Custom follow-up body in **markdown**"

# Update an existing draft
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> subject "New subject line"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> body "Plain text body"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> mdbody "**Markdown** body"
# to: replaces the To line. cc/bcc: append to existing (deduped, case-insensitive).
# All three accept a comma/semicolon-separated list of addresses.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> to "new-recipient@example.com"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> cc "one@example.com, two@example.com"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> bcc "bcc@example.com"
# Pass an empty string to clear all CC/BCC recipients (e.g. to trim a reply-all to sender-only):
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> cc ""
# Mark a draft high/low importance:
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> importance high
# Send as an alias (see "Sending as an alias" below):
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> from "alias@example.com"

# List drafts
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh drafts
```

**Note:** `mddraft`, `mdreply`, and `update mdbody` require `pandoc` for markdown conversion. Install with `brew install pandoc` (macOS) or `apt install pandoc` (Linux).

### Sending as an alias

A mailbox can send as its primary address or any of its aliases (proxy addresses). List them first — never guess an alias:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh aliases
```

Set the From address on **any** draft with `update <draft-id> from`. This works on every draft — including those made by `reply`, `mdreply`, `forward`, and `followup` — so it is the way to send as an alias:

```bash
# Draft, set the alias, confirm, then send
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh draft "recipient@example.com" "Subject" "Body"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> from "alias@example.com"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh send <draft-id>

# Replies work the same way - create the reply, then set the alias
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mdreply <message-id> "**Thanks** - see below."
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh update <draft-id> from "alias@example.com"
```

To default every new `draft` / `mddraft` to an alias, set `OUTLOOK_FROM_ADDRESS` (these apply only to the two create commands, not to replies — use `update from` for those):

```bash
OUTLOOK_FROM_ADDRESS="alias@example.com" ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh draft "to@example.com" "Subject" "Body"
```

Rules and behaviour:

1. **Always confirm the From line with the user before sending as an alias.** Which identity a message goes out as is as consequential as who receives it — `update from` and `send` both print the From address, so check it.
2. **Tenant support is required.** Send-from-alias only works when the tenant has `SendFromAliasEnabled` set (`Set-OrganizationConfig -SendFromAliasEnabled $true`). Without it, Exchange silently rewrites the From back to the primary address — so verify a test send actually arrived as the alias before relying on it.
3. **An unrecognised address warns rather than blocks**, because SendAs rights on a *shared* mailbox are real but never appear in this mailbox's alias list. If the address genuinely is not permitted, `send` fails with `ErrorSendAsDenied` and nothing is sent — a wrong alias cannot leak out.
4. **`OUTLOOK_FROM_NAME` is usually ignored.** Exchange overrides the display name with the mailbox's own for addresses it owns; the address is what changes.
5. **Check the alias domain's DNS before sending externally.** An alias on a domain with no DKIM signing or DMARC record may be spam-filtered by strict receivers even though the send itself succeeds.

**IMPORTANT:** Always prefer `mdreply` over `reply` for professional emails - plain text replies look poorly formatted in Outlook.

**Reply-chain preservation:** `update mdbody` automatically preserves the quoted reply chain on drafts created via `mdreply` or `followup` (an invisible `<span data-mdreply-chain-start="1">` marker is injected when the reply is created, and `update mdbody` splits on it). The plain `update body` command does NOT preserve the chain - if you need to edit a reply draft body, use `update mdbody`.

### Attachments

**Reading attachments:**
```bash
# List attachments on a message
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh attachments <message-id>

# Download ALL attachments to ./inbox/
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh download <message-id>

# Download specific attachment
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh download <message-id> <attachment-id>
```

**Adding attachments to drafts:**
```bash
# Add attachment to a draft (supports files up to 150MB)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh attach <draft-id> <file-path>
```

Upload method is automatic based on file size:
- **Small files (< 3MB):** Direct base64 upload - instant
- **Large files (3MB - 150MB):** Chunked upload with progress indicator

Multiple attachments can be added by calling `attach` multiple times on the same draft.

### Email Management

```bash
# Mark as read
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh markread <message-id>

# Mark as unread
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh markunread <message-id>

# Flag / unflag for follow-up (list flagged messages with `flagged`)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh flag <message-id>
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh unflag <message-id>

# Categories: list the mailbox's master category names, then apply them.
# Comma-separated list replaces the message's categories; "" clears them.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh categories
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh categorize <message-id> "Red category, Invoices"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh categorize <message-id> ""

# --add and --remove change one category and leave the others alone. Prefer them
# over the comma-separated form whenever you are not deliberately replacing the
# whole list.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh categorize <message-id> --add "Follow up"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh categorize <message-id> --remove "Follow up"

# Master category list. A colour is a name (red, dark blue, ...) or a presetN
# value; run the command with no colour to create one without a colour.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mkcategory "Follow up" red
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh rccategory "Follow up" "dark blue"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh rmcategory "Follow up"

# There is no rename: Graph makes displayName immutable once a category exists.
# mkcategory is safe to re-run: an existing name is reported, not an error.
# rmcategory removes the category from the master list only. Messages already
# carrying the label keep it; strip them with categorize --remove.

# Junk handling (move to Junk Email / rescue back to Inbox)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh junk <message-id>
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh notjunk <message-id>

# Delete
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh delete <message-id>

# Archive
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh archive <message-id>

# Move to any folder. Names resolve identically across move/batch-move/folder/
# rename/rmdir/mkdir: a bare name is matched case-insensitively anywhere in the
# folder tree (shallowest wins on a tie); use a "Parent/Child" path to target a
# specific nested folder when the same name exists in more than one place.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh move <message-id> "Projects"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh move <message-id> "Clients/Acme"

# Move MANY messages at once (batches of 20 via the Graph $batch endpoint).
# The destination folder is resolved once, so this is far faster than looping
# `move`. IDs may be passed as arguments or piped via stdin.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh batch-move "Projects" <id1> <id2> <id3>
# Pipe IDs from a listing (one per line or space-separated):
some_command_that_prints_ids | ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh batch-move "Projects"
```

**Bulk sorting note:** to reorganise a whole inbox, list messages, group their
IDs by destination folder, then call `batch-move` once per folder (piping the
IDs). Moving a message assigns it a NEW id in the destination folder, so if you
need to move it again, re-fetch ids from the destination folder first.

### Folder Management

```bash
# List top-level folders
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh folders

# List subfolders of a folder (default: inbox)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh subfolders
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh subfolders "Important"

# Create a new top-level folder
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mkdir "Projects"

# Create a subfolder under an existing folder
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mkdir "Acme" "Clients"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh mkdir "Urgent" inbox

# Rename a folder (refuses well-known system folders)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh rename "Old Name" "New Name"

# Delete a folder (refuses non-empty folders unless --force; refuses system
# folders always). With --force, contents move to Deleted Items.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh rmdir "Empty Folder"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh rmdir "Old Folder" --force

# Inbox statistics (total, unread counts)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh stats
```

## Calendar Operations

### Viewing Calendar

```bash
# Upcoming events (default 10)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh events

# Today's events
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh today

# This week
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh week

# A specific date
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh day 2026-07-20

# Find events by subject/location text (default: next 90 days)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh search "board meeting"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh search "dentist" 365

# Read event details
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh read <event-id>

# List calendars
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh calendars
```

### Creating Events

```bash
# Create event (dates in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM format). Without attendees, NOTHING
# is sent to anyone - this is the safe "draft" step.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh create "Meeting subject" "2025-02-05T14:00" "2025-02-05T15:00" "Conference Room A"

# Quick 1-hour event
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh quick "Team standup" "2025-02-05T09:00"
```

### Inviting Attendees (two-step flow - REQUIRED for meetings)

Mirror the email draft-then-send workflow: `create` the event with no attendees
(nothing is sent), show the user the event details AND the attendee list, and
only after explicit approval run `invite` - that is the moment invitations go
out.

```bash
# Step 1: create the event (no attendees - nothing sent)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh create "Project kickoff" "2025-02-05T14:00" "2025-02-05T15:00" "Teams"

# Step 2: after the user approves, send the invitations.
# Emails are comma/semicolon-separated; re-inviting an address is a no-op
# (deduped case-insensitively), so invite can be run again to add people.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh invite <event-id> "a@x.com, b@y.com"

# Optional (non-required) attendees:
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh invite <event-id> "c@z.com" optional
```

One-shot alternative: `create` also accepts an attendee list as a sixth
argument (`create <subject> <start> <end> [location] [attendees]` - pass "" for
location if there is none). This sends invitations IMMEDIATELY on creation, so
only use it when the user has already approved the exact attendee list in this
conversation. When in doubt, use the two-step flow.

### Invitations and Cancellation

```bash
# Respond to a meeting invitation (notifies the organiser)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh respond <event-id> accept
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh respond <event-id> decline "Sorry, I have a clash"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh respond <event-id> tentative

# Cancel a meeting YOU organise (notifies all attendees); `delete` removes an
# event silently. Use cancel for meetings with attendees, delete for your own
# solo events.
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh cancel <event-id> "Postponed - new invite to follow"
```

### Availability

```bash
# Check free/busy
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh free "2025-02-05T09:00" "2025-02-05T17:00"
```

## Workflow: Capturing Email to Notes

When the user wants to capture an email into a notes vault or knowledge base:

1. List emails to find the one to capture
2. Read the full message content
3. Check for attachments with `attachments` command
4. Download any attachments (goes to `./inbox/`)
5. Create a markdown file in the user's chosen notes/`inbox/` directory:

```markdown
# Email: [Subject]

**From:** sender@example.com
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Captured:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Content
[Email body]

## Attachments
- [[inbox/filename.pdf]] (captured)

## Notes
[User's annotations]
```

## Workflow: Processing Email Attachments

When user wants to grab attachments from an email:

1. Find the email: `inbox`, `search`, or `from` commands
2. List attachments: `attachments <message-id>`
3. Download: `download <message-id>` (all) or `download <message-id> <attachment-id>` (specific)
4. Files land in `./inbox/` for processing
5. User allocates files to appropriate areas during review

## Workflow: Sending Email

Always draft first, confirm, then send:

1. Create draft with `draft` or `mddraft` command
2. If sending as an alias, run `aliases` to get the exact address, then `update <draft-id> from <alias>`
3. Show user the draft content - including the From line whenever it is not the primary address
4. Wait for "send it" or change requests
5. Update draft if needed
6. Send with `send` command only after explicit approval

## Workflow: Sending Email with Attachments

1. Create draft with `draft` or `mddraft` command
2. Add attachments with `attach <draft-id> <file-path>` (repeat for multiple files)
3. Show user the draft details and attached files
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Send with `send` command only after explicit approval

**Example:**
```bash
# Create draft
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh draft "bob@example.com" "Q4 Report" "Please find the report attached."
# Output: Draft ID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Attach files (can be called multiple times)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh attach xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx /path/to/report.pdf
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh attach xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx /path/to/data.xlsx

# Send after user confirms
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh send xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Workflow: Sending Follow-up / Chaser Emails

When user wants to follow up on an email they sent:

1. List sent items with `sent` command to find the original email
2. Create follow-up with `followup <sent-id>` (uses default message) or provide custom body
3. Show user the draft content
4. Wait for confirmation or changes
5. Send with `send` command only after explicit approval

**Example:**
```bash
# Find the original sent email

## Workflow: Creating Calendar Events

Always confirm before creating, and never send invitations without a second
explicit approval:

1. Parse user's request for: subject, start time, end time, location, attendees
2. Show proposed event details to user
3. Wait for confirmation or adjustments
4. Create event only after explicit "yes" / approval - WITHOUT attendees
5. If the meeting has attendees: show the attendee list, wait for explicit
   approval, then send invitations with `invite <event-id> <emails>`
