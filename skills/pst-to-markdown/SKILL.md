# PST Email Extraction

Extract emails from Outlook PST files into an organised, integrity-verified archive of markdown files, raw email backups, and attachments. Supports full extraction and incremental append mode.

## Prerequisites

- Python virtual environment set up (run setup.sh if not done)
- At least one of: `libratom` (Python) or `readpst` (system tool from pst-utils)

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# Set up Python environment (one-time)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/setup.sh
```

### System Dependencies (optional fallback)

If libratom installation fails, install readpst as a fallback:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install pst-utils

# macOS
brew install libpst
```

## Extraction Operations

### Full Extraction

Extract all emails from a PST file into markdown:

```bash
# Basic extraction
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/

# Verbose output with progress
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --verbose

# Include deleted items
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --include-deleted --verbose

# Set timezone for date display
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --timezone "Europe/London"

# Fix MAILER-DAEMON sent items (provide the PST owner's email)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --owner-email "user@example.com"
```

### Incremental Extraction (Append Mode)

Add only new emails (skips already-extracted messages by Message-ID):

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/file.pst /path/to/output/ --append --verbose
```

### Keeping an Archive Current from Live Mail

A PST is a snapshot. To carry an archive forward, export new mail with the
sibling `outlook-graph` skill and append it — the two produce the same shape.

```bash
# 1. Export live mail as .eml (needs outlook-graph configured)
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../outlook-graph/scripts/outlook-graph-mail.sh \
  export "Inbox/Clients" ./staging/ --since 2026-07-01

# 2. Append it to the existing archive
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py \
  ./staging/ ./archive/ --append
```

Deduplication is by `Message-ID`, so a `--since` window that overlaps what is
already archived costs bandwidth and nothing else. Graph-sourced mail is
recorded under the `pst_folder` index column like any other — the column means
"the folder this message came from", and always did.

This guarantee depends on the message actually carrying a `Message-ID`
header. Received mail always has one, but a message with none (some drafts,
some malformed mail) has no key to dedupe on and is re-archived as a fresh
entry on every overlapping run. Narrow in practice, but real — there is no
content-hash fallback.

### Extract from Pre-Extracted .eml Directory

If emails were already extracted with readpst elsewhere, point at the directory:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py /path/to/eml-directory/ /path/to/output/
```

└── manifest.sha256                    # Master integrity manifest
```

### Email Markdown Format

Each `email.md` contains:
- **YAML frontmatter**: message_id, date, from, to, cc, subject, attachments with SHA256 hashes
- **Formatted body**: HTML converted to markdown, or plain text preserved
- **Attachment links**: Relative links to extracted files with sizes
- **Original headers**: Full RFC 822 headers in code block

### Index Files

- **index.csv**: All emails with date, sender, recipient, subject, folder, attachment count
- **index.md**: Timeline view grouped by year/month with links to each email

## CLI Reference

```
extract_pst.py [-h] [--include-deleted] [--timezone TZ] [--verbose] [--append] [--owner-email EMAIL] pst_file output_dir
```

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `pst_file` | Path to PST file, or directory of pre-extracted .eml files |
| `output_dir` | Output directory (created if needed) |
| `--include-deleted` | Include deleted items from PST |
| `--timezone TZ` | Target timezone for dates (default: UTC) |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Verbose output with per-email logging |
| `--append` | Skip emails already in archive (by Message-ID) |
| `--owner-email EMAIL` | PST owner's email (fixes MAILER-DAEMON in sent items) |

## Extraction Backends

The tool tries backends in priority order:

1. **libratom** (Python) - preferred, installed via requirements.txt
2. **readpst** (system CLI) - fallback, from pst-utils package
3. **Directory mode** - processes pre-extracted .eml files directly

## Integrity Verification

Every extraction produces a verifiable chain of custody:

1. Each email folder has `checksums.sha256` (SHA256 of all its files)
2. `manifest.sha256` hashes all checksum files plus the index
3. Source PST SHA256 is recorded in the manifest

To verify: `sha256sum -c manifest.sha256`

## Workflow: Extract and Search

Extract, then search the markdown with ripgrep. There is no semantic index - the output is plain files on disk, so use whatever search you already trust.

```bash
# Step 1: Extract
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/.venv/bin/python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pst.py archive.pst ./email-output/ --verbose

# Step 2: Search the output
rg -i "settlement agreement" ./email-output/ -l
```

Grep is exact, so search on names, addresses and distinctive phrases rather than concepts.

## Error Handling

- **"readpst not found"**: Install pst-utils or ensure libratom is installed via setup.sh
- **Corrupt emails**: Logged to extraction_log.txt, processing continues
- **Encoding issues**: Falls back through UTF-8 → latin-1 → raw bytes
- **Duplicate timestamps**: Appended with -001, -002 suffixes
- **Path too long**: Subject truncated, uniqueness preserved

## Performance

| Scenario | Approximate Speed |
|----------|-------------------|
| Emails without attachments | ~5,000/hour |
| Emails with attachments | ~2,000/hour |

A typical 300MB PST (~1,000-3,000 emails) processes in 5-15 minutes.
