# Accounts, tokens and things going wrong

Running more than one mailbox, and what to do when authentication stops working.

## More than one mailbox

Each account keeps its own credentials under `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/`. Add one:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/outlook-graph/scripts/outlook-graph-setup.sh --account work
```

That reuses the Azure app registration you already have if it finds one, so a second mailbox
is a sign-in rather than a fresh registration.

Every script resolves the active account the same way, in this order:

1. `--account <name>` or `-a <name>`, before the command
2. the `OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT` environment variable
3. `default`

```bash
mail.sh -a work inbox
OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT=work mail.sh inbox
~/.claude/skills/outlook-graph/scripts/outlook-graph-token.sh list
```

An install predating multi-account support keeps its files flat at
`~/.outlook-graph/{config,credentials,id_cache}.json`. The first run of any script moves them
into `~/.outlook-graph/default/`. Nothing to do, but do not be surprised.

## Checking the connection

```bash
token.sh test        # end-to-end: token, Graph call, inbox counts
token.sh status      # whether the token still works, and whose mailbox it is
token.sh refresh     # force a refresh
token.sh get         # print the raw access token
token.sh list        # accounts on this machine
```

Tokens refresh automatically whenever a command needs one, so `refresh` is a diagnostic
rather than something to schedule.

`token.sh get` is how you make a Graph call the scripts do not cover:

```bash
T=$(token.sh get)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" \
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/<id>?\$select=toRecipients,ccRecipients"
```

## When it stops working

**"Account 'x' not configured"** - there is no `credentials.json` under
`~/.outlook-graph/x/`. Run setup with `--account x`, or check you have not typo'd the name.

**Token expired, and refresh also failed.** Refresh tokens last around 90 days of inactivity.
Past that, re-authenticate: `outlook-graph-setup.sh`, or steps 6 and 7 of
[`references/setup.md`](../../skills/outlook-graph/references/setup.md) by hand.

**"Invalid client secret".** Client secrets are visible once, at creation. If yours is lost or
expired, make a new one in the Azure portal under *Certificates & secrets* and update
`client_secret` in `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/config.json`.

**"AADSTS50011: Reply URL does not match".** The redirect URI in the app registration must be
exactly `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.

**"Insufficient privileges".** The five delegated permissions - `Mail.ReadWrite`, `Mail.Send`,
`Calendars.ReadWrite`, `User.Read`, `offline_access` - are not all present or not all
consented. Add them, then sign out and in again to re-consent.

**Markdown commands failing.** `mddraft`, `mdreply`, `forward`, `followup` and `update mdbody`
shell out to `pandoc`. Install it.

**Calendar times an hour out.** Set `OUTLOOK_TZ` - see [running the
calendar](calendar.md#fix-the-timezone-first).

**A short ID that will not resolve.** Short IDs are cached by whichever listing produced them,
and a message that has been moved has a **new** ID in its new folder. Re-list from where the
message is now.

## What is stored, and where

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/config.json` | Azure app client ID and secret, tenant, scopes |
| `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/credentials.json` | OAuth access and refresh tokens |
| `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/id_cache.json` | Short ID to full Graph ID mapping |

The account directory is `700` and both credential files `600`, in your home directory and
nowhere else. Nothing is sent anywhere except
Microsoft Graph, directly from your machine. There are no secrets in this repository and
none in the skill.
