# Running the calendar

Viewing a diary, booking a meeting without accidentally inviting anyone, answering
invitations, and getting the timezone right.

`calendar.sh` below is
`~/.claude/skills/outlook-graph/scripts/outlook-graph-calendar.sh`.

## Fix the timezone first

Every time this script prints or accepts is wall-clock in one zone, resolved in this order:
`OUTLOOK_TZ`, then `/etc/timezone`, then `timedatectl`, then the `/etc/localtime` symlink,
and `Europe/London` if none of those answer.

On a laptop that is usually right. On a server, container or CI box it is UTC while you are
not, and a 14:00 London meeting is reported as 13:00 - same instant, wrong wall-clock, missed
meeting. When the resolved zone is UTC and you have not set `OUTLOOK_TZ`, the script says so
on stderr before every command. Believe it:

```bash
export OUTLOOK_TZ=Europe/London
```

The script cannot read the mailbox's own timezone, because that needs a
`MailboxSettings.Read` scope the app deliberately does not ask for. So it warns instead of
guessing.

## Looking at the diary

```bash
calendar.sh today
calendar.sh week
calendar.sh day 2026-08-13
calendar.sh events 20                    # next N, whenever they are
calendar.sh search "board meeting"       # next 90 days by default
calendar.sh search "dentist" 365
calendar.sh read <event-id>
```

`read` is the one that shows attendees, their responses, the body and the organiser - list
views do not.

## Booking a meeting

Do this in two steps, always, unless the exact attendee list has already been agreed.

**Step one, create the event with no attendees. Nothing is sent to anyone:**

```bash
calendar.sh create "Project kickoff" "2026-08-13T14:00" "2026-08-13T15:00" "Teams"
```

Times are `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` in your configured zone. At this point the event exists in your
own calendar and no one else knows about it, which is the calendar equivalent of a draft.

**Step two, once the attendee list has been confirmed, send the invitations:**

```bash
calendar.sh invite <event-id> "a@example.com, b@example.com"
calendar.sh invite <event-id> "c@example.com" optional
```

That is the moment mail goes out. Re-inviting an address already on the event is a no-op,
deduped case-insensitively, so `invite` is safe to run again to add someone.

`create` does accept attendees as a sixth argument - `create <subject> <start> <end>
[location] [attendees]`, with `""` for an absent location. That form sends invitations
**immediately on creation**, with no gap in which to check the list. Use it only when the
exact addresses have already been approved.

A one-hour event with no location, for when the meeting is with yourself:

```bash
calendar.sh quick "Write the board pack" "2026-08-13T09:00"
```

## Changing and cancelling

```bash
calendar.sh update <event-id> subject "Project kickoff (rescheduled)"
calendar.sh update <event-id> start "2026-08-14T14:00"
```

Updatable fields are `subject`, `location`, `start` and `end`.

Moving an event to a different day takes two calls, and the order matters: Graph rejects a
`start` later than the event's current `end`, and an `end` earlier than its current `start`.
Set whichever bound keeps start before end first.

Cancelling and deleting are not the same operation:

```bash
calendar.sh cancel <event-id> "Postponed - new invite to follow"
calendar.sh delete <event-id>
```

`cancel` is for meetings you organise: it withdraws the meeting and tells every attendee, with
your comment. `delete` removes the event silently. Deleting a meeting other people have in
their calendars leaves it in theirs - use `cancel` whenever anyone else is involved.

## Answering an invitation

```bash
calendar.sh respond <event-id> accept
calendar.sh respond <event-id> tentative
calendar.sh respond <event-id> decline "Sorry, I have a clash"
```

The organiser is notified either way. The comment is optional and only worth adding when it
says something the organiser cannot infer.

## Finding a slot

```bash
calendar.sh free "2026-08-13T09:00" "2026-08-13T17:00"
```

Either "You are FREE during this time period" or a list of what is in the way, with times.
Both bounds are converted to offset-qualified ISO before they reach Graph, so a window given
in local wall-clock is not silently read as UTC and shifted an hour in summer. Worth running
before you propose a time rather than after someone declines.
