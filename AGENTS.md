# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and people) working in this repository.

## What this is

The **Outlook** skill for AI coding agents - Microsoft 365 email and calendar via the Microsoft Graph API. It follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) layout (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) and ships as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).

## Layout

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json        # plugin manifest
.github/workflows/validate.yml    # CI: parse, unit tests, frontmatter, py matrix
skills/outlook-graph/SKILL.md     # the live mail/calendar skill (agent-facing)
skills/outlook-graph/scripts/     # bash scripts (self-contained: jq + curl + az)
skills/outlook-graph/references/  # manual setup guide (ships with the skill)
skills/outlook-to-md/SKILL.md     # the offline archive skill (agent-facing)
skills/outlook-to-md/scripts/     # outlook_to_md.py, run from its own .venv
docs/                             # human-facing documentation, see docs/README.md
install.sh / install-codex.sh     # local symlink installers (Claude / Codex)
```

Two audiences, kept apart deliberately. `skills/*/SKILL.md` and `skills/*/references/` are
loaded by the agent at runtime and ship with the skill. `docs/` is for people and is not
installed - so a fact needed at runtime belongs in the skill, not only in `docs/`.

## Conventions

- Scripts are self-contained: they read credentials from `~/.outlook-graph/<account>/` and have no bundled-path dependencies, so they run from any location.
- SKILL.md references scripts via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (the skill's own directory), which Claude Code substitutes for personal, project, and plugin installs alike. `install.sh` therefore symlinks the whole skill directory into `~/.claude/skills/` (no rewrite). `install-codex.sh` still rewrites the variable to the install path, since Codex does not substitute it.
- Shell scripts use `set -e`; errors go to stderr, structured output to stdout.
- No secrets in the repo - credentials live under `~/.outlook-graph/`.
- House style: British English, plain hyphens.

## Validating a change

```bash
bash -n skills/outlook-graph/scripts/*.sh    # scripts parse
shellcheck skills/outlook-graph/scripts/*.sh # lint (warnings should be clean)
bash skills/outlook-graph/tests/helpers_test.sh  # offline unit tests (no account needed)
python3 -m pytest skills/outlook-to-md/tests/ -q # archive suite (no PST needed)
claude plugin validate .                     # manifest + structure
```

`tests/helpers_test.sh` extracts the pure helpers (search encoding/paging/sort,
folder resolution, token-expiry logic) from the scripts and runs them against a
mocked Graph API, so it catches regressions without a live mailbox. Anything that
needs real Graph calls (token refresh, actual search results) still wants a
manual smoke test against a configured account.
